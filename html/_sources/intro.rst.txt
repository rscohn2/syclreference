 Introduction
==============


Obtaining high compute performance on todayâ€™s modern computer
architectures requires code that is optimized, power efficient, and
scalable. The demand for high performance continues to increase due to
needs in AI, video analytics, data analytics, as well as in traditional
high performance computing (HPC).


Modern workload diversity has resulted in a need for architectural
diversity; no single architecture is best for every workload. A mix of
scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial (SVMS) architectures deployed in
CPU, GPU, AI, and FPGA :term:`accelerators <accelerator>` is required
to extract the needed performance.


Today, coding for CPUs and accelerators requires different languages,
libraries, and tools. That means each hardware platform requires
completely separate software investments and provides limited
application code reusability across different target architectures.


The oneAPI programming model simplifies the programming of CPUs and
accelerators using modern C++ features to express parallelism with a
programming language called Data Parallel C++ (DPC++). The DPC++
language enables code reuse for the host (such as a CPU) and
accelerators (such as a GPU) using a single source language, with
execution and memory dependencies clearly communicated. Mapping within
the DPC++ code can be used to transition the application to run on the
hardware, or set of hardware, that best accelerates the workload. A host
is available to simplify development and debugging of device code, even
on platforms that do not have an accelerator available.


.. note::

   Not all programs can benefit from the single programming model
   offered by oneAPI. It is important to understand if your program can
   benefit and how to design, implement, and use the oneAPI programming
   model for your program.

Overview
========


The oneAPI programming model provides a comprehensive and unified
portfolio of developer tools that can be used across hardware targets,
including a range of performance libraries spanning several workload
domains. The libraries include functions custom-coded for each target
architecture, so the same function call delivers optimized performance
across supported architectures. DPC++ is based on industry standards and
open specifications to encourage ecosystem collaboration and innovation.

As shown in the figure above, applications that take advantage of the
oneAPI programming model can execute on multiple target hardware
platforms ranging from CPU to FPGA. 


Data Parallel C++ (DPC++)
=========================


Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) is a high-level language designed for data
parallel programming productivity. It is based on C++ for broad
compatibility and uses common, familiar C and C++ constructs. The
language seeks to deliver performance on par with other compiled
languages, such as standard C++ compiled code, and uses C++ class
libraries to allow the compiler to interpret the code and run on various
supported architectures.


DPC++ is based on SYCL\* from the Khronos\* Group to support data
parallelism and heterogeneous programming. In addition, Intel is
pursuing extensions to SYCL with the aim of providing value to customer
code and working with the standards organization for adoption. For
instance, the DPC++ language includes an implementation of unified
shared memory to ease memory usage between the host and the
accelerators. These features are being driven into a future version of
the SYCL language. For more details about SYCL, refer to version 1.2.1
of the `SYCL
Specification <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-1.2.1.pdf>`__.


While DPC++ applications can run on any supported target hardware,
tuning is required to gain the best performance advantage on a given
target architecture. For example, code tuned for a CPU likely will not
run as fast on a GPU accelerator without modification. This guide aims
to help developers understand how to program using the oneAPI
programming model and how to target and optimize for the appropriate
architecture to achieve optimal application performance.
