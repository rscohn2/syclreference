=====================
Programming Interface
=====================

For further details on SYCL, see the `SYCL
Specification <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-1.2.1.pdf>`__.


Header File
===========

A single header file must be included::

  #include "sycl.hpp"


Namespaces
==========

Unless otherwise noted, all symbols should be prefixed with the
``cl::sycl`` namespace. ``buffer`` is ``cl::sycl::buffer``, and
``info::device::name`` is ``cl::sycl::info::device::name``.

Data access
===========

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   data/buffer
