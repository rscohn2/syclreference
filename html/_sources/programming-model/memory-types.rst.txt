      * -     Constant Memory     
        -     A region of global memory that remains constant during    the execution of a kernel. The host allocates and initializes memory   objects placed into constant memory.    
      * -     Global Memory     
        -     Accessible to all work-items in all work-groups.    Read/write, may be cached, persistent across kernel invocations.      
      * -     Local Memory     
        -     Shared between work-items in a single work-group and    inaccessible to work-items in other work-groups. Example: Shared   local memory on Intel HD Graphics 530    
      * -     Private Memory     
        -     A region of memory private to a work-item. Variables    defined in one work-itemâ€™s private memory are not visible to another   work-item. Example: Register File on Intel HD Graphics 530
