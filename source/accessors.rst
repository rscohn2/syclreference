Accessors
=========


Accessors provide access to buffers and images in the host or inside the
kernel and also communicate data dependencies between the application
and different kernels. The accessor communicates the data type, the
size, the target, and the access mode. To enable good performance, pay
particular attention to the target because the accessor specifies the
memory type from the choices in the SYCL memory model.


The targets associated with buffers are:


-  global_buffer
-  host_buffer
-  constant_buffer
-  local


The targets associated with images are:


-  image
-  host_image
-  image_array


Image access must also specify a channel order to communicate the format
of the data being read. For example, an image may be specified as a
``float4``, but accessed with a channel order of RGBA.


The access mode impacts correctness as well as performance and is one of
``read``, ``write``, ``read_write``, ``discard_write``,
``discard_read_write``, or ``atomic``. Mismatches in access mode and
actual memory operations such as a ``write`` to a ``buffer`` with access
mode ``read`` can result in compiler diagnostics as well as erroneous
program state. The ``discard_write`` and ``discard_read_write`` access
modes can provide performance benefits for some implementations. For
further details on accessors, see the SYCL Specification.
