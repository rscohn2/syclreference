API-based Programming
=====================


Several libraries are available with oneAPI toolkits that can simplify
the programming process by providing specialized APIs for use in
optimized applications. This chapter provides basic details about the
libraries, including code samples, to help guide the decision on which
library is most useful in certain use cases. Detailed information about
each library, including more about the available APIs, is available in
the main documentation for that library.
