Direct Programming
==================


The `vector addition sample
code <sample-program.html>`__ is employed in
this example. It takes advantage of the oneAPI programming model to
perform the addition on an accelerator.


The following command compiles and links the executable.


::


   dpcpp vector_add.cpp


The components and function of the command and options are similar to
those discussed in the `API-Based
Code <api-based-code.html>`__ section.


Execution of this command results in the creation of an executable file,
which performs the vector addition when run.
