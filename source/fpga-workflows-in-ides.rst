The oneAPI tools integrate with third-party integrated development
environments (IDEs) on Linux (Eclipse*) and Windows (Visual Studio*) to
provide a seamless GUI experience for software development. See `Intel
oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party
IDEs <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide>`__
