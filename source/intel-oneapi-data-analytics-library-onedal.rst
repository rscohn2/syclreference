Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)
============================================


Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a library that helps
speed up big data analysis by providing highly optimized algorithmic
building blocks for all stages of data analytics (preprocessing,
transformation, analysis, modeling, validation, and decision making) in
batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.


The library optimizes data ingestion along with algorithmic computation
to increase throughput and scalability. It includes C++ and Java\* APIs
and connectors to popular data sources such as Spark\* and Hadoop*.
Python\* wrappers for oneDAL are part of `Intel Distribution for
Python <https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python>`__.


In addition to classic features, oneDAL provides DPC++ API extensions to
the traditional C++ interface and enables GPU usage for some algorithms.


The library is particularly useful for distributed computation. It
provides a full set of building blocks for distributed algorithms that
are independent from any communication layer. This allows users to
construct fast and scalable distributed applications using
user-preferable communication means.


For general information, visit the `oneDAL GitHub\*
page <https://github.com/intel/daal>`__. The complete list of features
and documentation are available at the `official Intel oneAPI Data
Analytics Library
website <https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi/dal>`__. Free and
open-source community-supported versions are available, as well as paid
versions with premium support.
