Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)
=================================================


Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source
performance library for deep learning applications. The library includes
basic building blocks for neural networks optimized for Intel
Architecture Processors and Intel Processor Graphics. oneDNN is intended
for deep learning applications and framework developers interested in
improving application performance on Intel Architecture Processors and
Intel Processor Graphics. Deep learning practitioners should use one of
the applications enabled with oneDNN.


oneDNN is distributed as part of Intel® oneAPI DL Framework Developer
Toolkit, the Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit, and is available via apt and yum
channels.


oneDNN continues to support features currently available with DNNL,
including C and C++ interfaces, OpenMP*, Intel oneAPI Threading Building
Blocks, and OpenCL™ runtimes. oneDNN introduces DPC++ API and runtime
support for the oneAPI programming model.
