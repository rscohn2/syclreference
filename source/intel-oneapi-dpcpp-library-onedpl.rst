Intel oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL)
===================================


The Intel oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) works with the Intel oneAPI
DPC++ Compiler to provide high-productivity APIs. Using these APIs can
minimize DPC++ programming efforts across devices for high performance
parallel applications.


oneDPL consists of following components:


-  C++ standard APIs verified for DPC++ kernels
-  Parallel STL algorithms with execution policies to run on DPC++
   devices
-  Non-standard API extensions


Currently, Parallel STL has been integrated into oneDPL. Non-standard
API extensions are planned for gradual integration in future releases.
The testing results of C++ standard APIs on devices and the supported
Parallel STL and non-standard API extensions are posted in the oneDPL
Release Notes.

Guide <https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi-dpcpp-library-guide>`__.
