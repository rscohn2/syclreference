Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL)
=========================================


The Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) is a computing math
library of highly optimized and extensively parallelized routines for
applications that require maximum performance. oneMKL contains the
high-performance optimizations from the full IntelÂ® Math Kernel Library
for CPU architectures (with C/Fortran programming language interfaces)
and adds to them a set of Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) programming language
interfaces for achieving performance on various CPU architectures and
Intel Graphics Technology for certain key functionalities.


The new DPC++ interfaces with optimizations for CPU and GPU
architectures have been added for key functionality in the following
major areas of computation:


-  BLAS and LAPACK dense linear algebra routines
-  Sparse BLAS sparse linear algebra routines
-  Random number generators (RNG)
-  Vector Mathematics (VM) routines for optimized mathematical
   operations on vectors
-  Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)
