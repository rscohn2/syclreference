Intel oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB)
===============================================


Intel oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) is an open source
library to write parallel C++ programs that take full advantage of
multicore performance, are portable and composable, and have
future-proof scalability. Through community involvement, oneTBB is a
feature-rich and popular solution for developing shared memory parallel
applications. It has been used in production for data analytics,
creative content creation, and many other applications.


oneTBB is compiler-independent and is available on a variety of
processors and operating systems. It is used by other oneAPI libraries
(Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library, Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network
Library, etc.) to express multithreading parallelism for CPUs.
