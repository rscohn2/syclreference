Memory Objects
==============


Memory objects are either buffers or images.


-  Buffer object - a one-, two-, or three-dimensional array of elements.
   Buffers can be accessed via lower level C++ pointer types. For
   further information on buffers, see the SYCL Specification.
-  Image object - a formatted opaque memory object stored in a type
   specific and optimized fashion. Access occurs through built-in
   functions. Image objects typically pertain to pictures comprised of
   pixels stored in a format such as RGB (red, green, blue intensity).
   For further information on images, see the SYCL Specification.
