oneTBB Code Sample
==================


Two basic oneTBB code samples are available from the Intel oneAPI Base
Toolkit GitHub repository https://github.com/intel/BaseKit-code-samples.
The examples are illustrative of typical use cases and can serve as a
starting point for developers who want to experiment with using both
oneTBB and DPC++ in the same application.
