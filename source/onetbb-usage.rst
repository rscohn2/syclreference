oneTBB Usage
============


oneTBB can be used with the Intel oneAPI DPC++ Compiler in the same way
as with any other C++ Compiler. For more details, see the documentation
at https://software.intel.com/en-us/tbb.


Currently, oneTBB does not directly use any accelerators. However, it
can be combined with the DPC++ language and other oneAPI libraries to
build a program that efficiently utilizes all available hardware
resources.
