Recompile, Run, Profile, and Repeat
===================================


Once the code is optimized, it is important to measure the performance.
The questions to be answered include:


-  Did the metric improve?
-  Is the performance goal met?
-  Are there any more compute cycles left that can be used?


Confirm the results are correct. If you are comparing numerical results,
the numbers may vary depending on how the compiler optimized the code or
the modifications made to the code. Are any differences acceptable? If
not, go back to optimization step.
