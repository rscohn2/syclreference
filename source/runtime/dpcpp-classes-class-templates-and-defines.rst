The following sections provide further details on these items. These
sections do not provide the exhaustive details found in the SYCL
Specification. Instead, these sections provide:


-  A summary that includes a description and the purpose
-  Comments on the different constructors, if applicable
-  Member function information, if applicable
-  Special cases to consider with the DPC++ implementation compared to
   the SYCL Specification
