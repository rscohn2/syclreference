Single Source Compilation
=========================


The oneAPI programming model supports single source compilation. Single
source compilation has several benefits compared to separate host and
device code compilation. It should be noted that the oneAPI programming
model also supports separate host and device code compilation as some
users may prefer it. Advantages of the single source compilation model
include:


-  Usability – programmers need to create fewer files and can define
   device code right next to the call site in the host code.
-  Extra safety – single source means one compiler can see the boundary
   code between host and device and the actual parameters generated by
   host compiler will match formal parameters of the kernel generated by
   the device compiler.
-  Optimization - the device compiler can perform additional
   optimizations by knowing the context from which a kernel is invoked.
   For instance, the compiler may propagate some constants, infer
   pointer aliasing information across the function call.
